# Day 4 – EC2 Web Server Setup (Nginx)

## S – Situation
Our AWS EC2 instance was running but did not yet serve any web content.  
To simulate LaKeel DX’s cloud infrastructure needs, we required a basic HTTP server as a foundation for future applications.

## T – Task
Set up a cost-efficient, secure, and scalable web server (Nginx) on our AWS Free Tier EC2 instance, verify it works via browser, and prepare it for customization.

## A – Actions
1. **Started EC2 Instance**
   - Navigated to AWS Console → EC2 → Selected stopped instance → Start.
   - Copied updated Public IPv4 address.

2. **Connected via SSH**
   ```bash
   ssh -i "my-key.pem" ec2-user@<Public-IP>
